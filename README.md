## About the project

This is just a drawing machine that looks like <b>paint.net</b>. In this game, you can draw on the canvas, and then download your picture, use it later. The game is still underutilized, but I'm still working on it. In the meantime, enjoy the <b>demo</b> of the game using different tools. Hope you enjoy it. Thanks for attention.

## History of creation

The idea of this game came to me when I watched a <b>video tutorial on canvas</b>. And then I thought. From just a brush with color, you can make the whole game. Add pencil, size, eraser and more. I hope that I will be able to finish it to the end.

## Instruction

Below you will see which functions are already ready, and which still do not work, but will be soon. You can download the picture by right-clicking on it, and pressing (save as ...), after which it will be saved where you indicated it. I will be glad of any support from you, especially for development assistance. Write if you want to help.
